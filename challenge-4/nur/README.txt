Challenge#4: Developing Post-Disaster Housing Response

In the aftermath of natural disasters, effective planning and support are crucial to ensure that affordable housing remains available to marginalized communities. This analysis aims to address key questions regarding community vulnerability to disasters, focusing on the state of Florida. It highlights high-risk communities, their demographics, and the composition of their housing to inform proactive post-disaster support.

The projectâ€™s dataset focuses on Florida's housing landscape. Before conducting the analysis, columns representing the margin of error were removed from the dataset. A clustering method was employed to identify high-risk areas within the community. For visualization, Plotly, Folium, and Matplotlib were used to create both interactive and non-interactive plots. This data provides a foundation for understanding community vulnerability to disasters.

Three counties were identified as high-risk areas in terms of building loss, population loss, and energy burden. After identifying these areas, the next step was to understand their demographic and poverty status. The visualizations suggest that the population distribution across age groups (over 16, 18, and 60) is similar in the three identified regions. Poverty levels are noticeably high in two of the identified counties.

Limitations:
The main limitation of this project is that it only covers three features to identify vulnerable communities. Additionally, the dataset did not include historical data, making it impossible to conduct predictive analysis.

Future Plans:
The future plan involves gathering and cleaning historical data. Some American Community Survey (ACS) variables have been collected, further cleaning is needed. Additionally, acquire historical data related to natural disasters for predictive modeling. Enhance the visualizations to provide a clearer understanding of the data and help stakeholders make informed decisions. Include additional variables related to housing, socioeconomic status, and community infrastructure to provide a more holistic view of vulnerability.
