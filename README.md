### DataKit™ by DataKind
# Affordable Housing
Help us deliver insights, understanding, and solutions to address the housing crisis in the United States.

## What's a DataKit?
A DataKit™ is a work-ready set of data science problems, curated by [DataKind](https://www.datakind.org/), in a domain of social good. As you engage with a DataKit, you will apply your skills for social impact while deepening your understanding of problems common in the space. All learnings, ideas, and insights resulting from this DataKit will be aggregated and shared with DataKind’s network of housing collaborators, making your DataKit solutions directly accessible to housing actors across the United States. Select ideas and prototypes may be highlighted for expansion through partnerships.

## Problem to tackle
The United States faces a severe affordable housing crisis, with a [national shortage of over 7 million affordable homes](https://nlihc.org/explore-issues/why-we-care/problem) for more than 10.8 million extremely low-income families. There is no state or county in which a renter earning minimum wage can afford a two-bedroom apartment–even if working full time. As a result, 70% of these low-income families are severely cost-burdened, spending over half their income on rent, far above the recommended one-third threshold. [Homeless camps](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/03/business/economy/us-homeless-population-count.html) have expanded, and ["super commuters"](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/27/briefing/affordable-housing-crisis.html?unlocked_article_code=1.I04.L81I.jbtJBTVGU-9n&smid=url-share)–those who drive for 90 minutes or longer to work–have migrated well beyond the expensive coasts to smaller cities like Spokane, Wash., and fast-growing metropolitan areas like Dallas and Phoenix.

We’ve provided four challenges that stand to benefit from your data, software, and storytelling skills.

## Accessing the data
DataKind has compiled initial socio-economic datasets for two states: Florida and California. This data covers 350+ variables at the county and Census tract levels. We’ve stored this data in GitHub for you to work with. These datasets are sourced from DataKind’s own [Economic Opportunity DataScape](https://eodatascape.datakind.org/) product which you can further explore and use for this DataKit as needed.

Challenges can be found in the [Discussions](https://github.com/datakind/datakit-housing-event/discussions) area of the repository....
