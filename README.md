Check out my Tableau Public project for a detailed data visualization of low-income housing trends:

HUD's LIHTC database contains information on projects and housing units placed in service between 1987 and 2022. 
The visualizations show the units built in California and Florida, and those set aside for low income population. 
Special focus was made on units targeting disabled, elderly, families and homeless population, with details on house characteristics (number of bedrooms)
and annual amount of tax credits allocated (USD) when available.
