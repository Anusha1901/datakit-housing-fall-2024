A DataKit™ is a work-ready set of data science problems, curated by [DataKind](https://datakind.org), in a domain of social good. As you engage with a DataKit, you will apply your skills for social impact while deepening your understanding of problems common in the space. Your insights and solutions to the problems in a DataKit will inform DataKind’s continuing social impact work and be shared with our partnering social impact organizations.
