Join us in working to deliver insights, understanding, and solutions toward the housing crisis in the United States. To help put crisis in context, we’re including some key statistics here: 

From the [National Low Income Housing Coalition](https://nlihc.org/explore-issues/why-we-care/problem):

* Nationally, there is a shortage of more than 7 million affordable homes for our nation's 10.8 million plus extremely low-income families  
* There is no state or county where a renter working full-time at minimum wage can afford a two-bedroom apartment  
* Seventy percent of all extremely low-income families are severely cost-burdened, paying more than half their income on rent

From the [*New York Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/27/briefing/affordable-housing-crisis.html?unlocked_article_code=1.I04.L81I.jbtJBTVGU-9n&smid=url-share)

* Home prices are up about 60 percent over the past decade, adjusted for inflation  
* About a quarter of renters–some 12 million households–spend more than half their income on housing, far in excess of the one-third level that is considered healthy  
* [Homeless camps](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/03/business/economy/us-homeless-population-count.html) have expanded, and “[super commuters](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/17/business/economy/san-francisco-commute.html?mcubz=0)”–those who drive for 90 minutes or longer to work–have migrated well beyond the expensive coasts to smaller cities like [Spokane, Wash.](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/20/business/economy/spokane-housing-expensive-cities.html), and fast-growing metropolitan areas like Dallas and Phoenix.

We’ve identified five huge challenges that stand to benefit from your data, software, and storytelling skills. We’re identifying the questions below and providing some ideas for how to get started.
