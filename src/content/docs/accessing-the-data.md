DataKind has pulled together initial socio-economic datasets for two states: Florida and California. This data covers 350+ variables at the county and Census tract levels. We’ve stored this data in GitHub for you to work with, and the “getting started” questions in each section are set so you can use this data (without going to pull additional information!) 

These datasets are sourced from DataKind’s Economic Opportunity DataScape https://eodatascape.datakind.org and you can also use this resource to directly pull data resources.
